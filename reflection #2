When you initialize a repo, git creates a .gitignore file with begins saving
commits.

You need to do it to start saving version control.

A staging area differs from the working dir and repo because it allows a place
to specify which files to add to the repo without actually adding them

It can give you a place to set up your commits before you actually push them
to the repo.

With the staging area you can use git diff to see what changes you are
introducing making sure that you are not commiting too
many logical changes at once.

Using branches allows you to try multiple different things in your program.
For example when A/B testing new features in your website you can use git
branching to allow development of the website without new feature and the
website with new feature.

Have a master, production code branch where there is stable code, never breaks
New feature branches
experimental branches

How do you use to collaborate with yourself?
Allows you to context switch- i.e. fixing bug/ or working on new features

The diagrams show which nodes have pointers to which other nodes, allowing you to
see where is a probelm of an unreachabel node.

Manually merging can be kind of a pain- but will be proactive about resolving
conflicts- especially between two different devs.
