When you initialize a repo, git creates a .gitignore file with begins saving
commits.

You need to do it to start saving version control.

A staging area differs from the working dir and repo because it allows a place
to specify which files to add to the repo without actually adding them

It can give you a place to set up your commits before you actually push them
to the repo.
