How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Can see differences highlighted instead of scrolling through to see changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If system breaks at a certain point, you can forensically analyze which commit 
caused the break.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Sometimes you forget to save and your network crashes, which is an argument for automatic saves.

However, it might be useful to have to define a specific intention for each addition you are making
to the project.  Especially for collaboration- this would allow each team member to see changes
that get added to a project.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    for conflicts?  I am not sure how to answer this.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    You can see the commit history of your files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can make and execute and if it breaks, use diff to isolate what changes were made.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    to work on my udacity projects on the cloud across multiple devices (i.e. macbook, ipad, on browser on borrowed
computers)
