"""update for git pull practice"""


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To access from cloud/ rather than rely on local machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes you're just messing around with code and don't actually
    want to display it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone copies entire state of repo with all its commit history

    Branch will create a new branch for changes that can later be merged with
    the master.

    To play around with the original without affecting the originial project
    To propose changes to someone elses project or use it as a starting point
    for you own.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    so you don't have to constantly be pushing changes to github- which would
    probably tie up network and computing resources

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Probably dropbox and a very stringent version control system

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    To experiment and create a prototype of a new feature without affecting
    the production code.

Forks: to clone a repo that you don't own and make you're own changes to it.

Clone: to create a copy of the rep with the entire commit history

Branches: to create a copy of the repo with commit history, but to diverge
from master so new commits are not added to the master branch

Benefit of having last known state stored locally- so you can work on plane if you are offline
